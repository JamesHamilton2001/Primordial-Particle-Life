# Primordial Particle Life

A 2D particle physics simulation, modelled in an infinite, that aims to displaying emergent properties akin to Conway's Game of Life, using physics in a continuous domain.

This was my 3rd year final project, now it's actually just my project, my Progress Report and Final Report are attached as part of the documentation.

## Things You Should Know

### No Delta-Time Coefficient

To keep results deterministic, the time frame of the simulation is dependant on the framerate. It can be standardised by capping the framerate.

## Run/Debug the Project

### Core Application

Provided you're also working with vscode, and you have raylib setup with w64devkit. It should be as simple as cloning the repository, opening it in vscode and pressing F5.

I've used a vscode template as a foundation. I have modified it to use C++17 instead of C++11, and only been tested with Windows 10 and 11. See the link below for the original template.

# Raylib-CPP-Starter-Template-for-VSCODE-V2
Raylib C++ Starter Template for Visual Studio Code on Windows.
This demo project contains a bouncing ball raylib example program.
It works with raylib version 4.5. Tested on both Windows 10 and Windows 11.

# How to use this template
1. Double click on the main.code-workspace file. This will open the template in VS Code.
2. From the Explorer Window of VS Code navigate to the src folder and double click on the main.cpp file.
3. Press F5 on the keyboard to compile and run the program.

# What's changed
The template now uses folders for better organizion of the files. So, all the source code now lives in the src folder.
